# configure does but if you move things around after running 
# "make install" this is where you would notify the CGI scripts.

# This file you're editing ends up in the PHILOSITECFG directory, as does
# a file with a perl hash of the available databases.  It's listed here so
# autoconf can insert it within other perl scripts, but once it's installed
# this variable is useless.  You might want to get rid of the ${prefix}
# here and elsewhere in this file, but it doesn't seem to break anything.

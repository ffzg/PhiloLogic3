PhiloLogic's distribution is still very much beta-quality, and to
date it has been installed almost exclusively by people who are
experts in its intricacies.  If don't complete an installation, even
if you just unpack it and lose interest, we'd really like to hear
about it so we can make the package install in a more sensible way.
Of course we'd love to hear that you have completed an installation
and are searching tons of text, as well.  Please write to
support@philologic.uchicago.edu with your reports.

depends: gawk, perl, gdbm/gdbm-dev, gnutar, egrep, GNU ld (binutils),
	 gnu sort (coreutils)
 
optional depends: mysql, agrep

If you have all the prerequisites in standard locations for your system,
installation is a snap:

$ ./configure CFLAGS="-O3" CPPFLAGS="-I/non/standard/include/path/" LDFLAGS="-L/non/standard/library/path/" --with-various-options 
#by default, GNU will set CFLAGS to "-g -O", which is relatively low-performance.  
#ARTFL reccommends CFLAGS="-O3" for blistering speed.
$ sudo make install
Manually add the cronjob from cgi-bin/hitlist.del.cron to crontab
$ less LOADING

Note that we don't run a default make command.  make install will 
build everything for you.


There are a reasonably large number of configurable options,
and although they will all default to reasonable values for whichever
operating system you happen to be using, you might want to make sure.

These are the key ./configure arguments [default Linux values follow in
brackets.  Configure will adjust for Mac OS X, and print out its opinion.]

  --with-authuser-group=groupname       name of group authorized to build
                                PhiloLogic databases [philologic]
  --with-cgi-path=DIR   sets filesystem path to cgi-bin directory
                        [/var/www/cgi-bin/philologic]
  --with-cgi-url=DIR    sets URL path to cgi-bin directory [/cgi-bin/philologic]
  --with-web-path=DIR   sets filesystem path for sample search page
                        and source downloads [/var/www/html/philologic]
  --with-web-url=DIR    sets URL path for sample search page
                        and source downloads [/philologic]
  --with-init-d=DIR     sets path to initscripts directory [/etc/init.d]
  --with-boot-init-d=DIR        sets path to default boot init.d directory
                                [/etc/rc2.d]

You may also want to set the autoconf variables
--sysconfdir=[something other than /etc], --bindir=[something other
than /bin] and --localstatedir=[something other than /var (by default
most of the install ends up in /var/lib/philologic)].  You can NOT
successfully specify a PREFIX with make install PREFIX=/usr/local;
this just ends up being ignored.

Mac OS X Hints
______________
Getting all the dependencies installed for Mac OS X can be a bit tricky.
GDBM's source distribution has a bungled makefile, so we reccommend using
Fink to grab it.  If you do that, however, Fink will install the libraries
and headers to a non-standard location, so you'll have to run configure 
with the appropriate CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS values set.  For example, if
Fink installs headers to /sw/include, and libraries to /sw/lib,
you should run configure like so:

./configure CFLAGS="-O3" CPPFLAGS="-I/sw/include/" LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib/"

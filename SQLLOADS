HOW TO LOAD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA INTO MYSQL (and make it work)

Before you do anything else, you need to create a MySQL database
called "philologic" and a user called "philologic" (or maybe
philologic@localhost -- I can never tell) with a password of your
choosing.  Give the philologic user only select access to philologic.*
-- that's all it needs, as data loads will be done as real users.
This database will hold all the tables for any philologic loads for
which you choose SQL metadata handling.  You should then edit
/etc/philologic/philologic.cfg and enter the password for the
"philologic" MySQL user in the $PASSWD variable.

Then run philoload with an additional argument, --loadsql, before the
list of files to load (i.e. philoload mydatabase --loadsql *.xml).  It
will (after going through the rest of the load successfully) prompt
you for your MySQL password then load the data for you and make other
necessary changes.  It assumes that your MySQL username is the same as
your login username, and that you have a password.  If you have a
different MySQL username, specify it to philoload as
--sqluser=yoursqlusername.  If you don't have a password, specify
--nosqlpass.

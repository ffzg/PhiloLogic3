To create frequncy tables, search forms and cgis scripts for your 
database issue the command, from within this directory:

makefrequencies yourdatabase

If this does not work, check the perl path specified in makefrequencies 
and adjust it to be your path. Also, make sure that perl is in your 
shell's PATH.

Then, check your webpath for yourdatabase.frequencylists.html and 
yourdatabase.timeseries.html. If all went well, you should be able 
to use these forms, editing them to suit your need and the specifics 
of your database.

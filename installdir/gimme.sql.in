# ======================== gimme.sql =============================
# This is an SQL interface designed to swap in for the standard
# gimme metadata/bibliographic search.  It reads from the command
# line a set of arguments coming from search2t, in the form of
# variable=some+args such as  title=original+fables.  The arguments
# may include boolean operators for non-numeric fields, designated
# in all caps and "+" (which get translated to spaces), thus
# title=original+AND+fables.  Multiple arguments are delimited
# by spaces:  title=essays author=margaret+NOT+newcastle
#
# This assumes that the data in SYSTEM_DIR/bibliography has
# been loaded into the mySQL server.
#
# We may add support for the "browsefield" function which has
# proven popular.  This runs a query on the metadata, but sorts
# and uniqs a selected field to see what values are left, so that
# the user can iteratively compose a query.  This is particularly
# helpful in cases where there are many metadata fields.
# ===============================================================
# Use the perl DBI interfacing package.  This is fully documented
# in Paul DuBois, MySQL (New Riders, 2000).  The perl:DBI package
# must be installed.

# order to support regular expression matching for wild cards,
# the poor man's tokenizer above, and our match all accented
# characters convention A = a[INT-INT].  But many, even most
# queries do not need this.  The mySQL regexp operator is slow
# and does not benefit from indexing in mySQL.  So, the following
# simply replaces "regexp" function with "like" if it matches
# characters.  One could extend or restrict this this pattern as 
# required in philo-db.cfg.   This needs to be turned ON in
# philo-db.cfg.  It is known to work for searches and browsefields.
# Makes a huge difference for searches on large tables.

2004-11-15  Orion Buckminster Montoya  <orion@philologic.uchicago.edu>
	* added a bunch of files:artfl_sortedkwic.pl, dublin.extract.pl,
	philohistory.pl, theme_rheme.pl.  goodies/ directory has various
	things that are cool and some people might want; see README there.
	
2004-08-23  Orion Buckminster Montoya  <orion@philologic.uchicago.edu>
	* added boilerplate.plin to give desired format for new files

2004-07-08  Orion Buckminster Montoya  <orion@philologic.uchicago.edu>
	* some fixes to egrep calls to embrace non-GNU versions
	* default PATH may now be set in /etc/philologic/philologic.cfg
	* halfway fixes of mysql functionality; --sqlpass= option to
	  philoload lets you specify your sql password for automatic
	  loads.
	* But right now MySQL metadata handling is known not to co-exist
	  with fulltext searching.
	* I think it's fair to say Solaris support is broken, if it
	  was ever working
	
2004-06-30  Orion Buckminster Montoya  <orion@philologic.uchicago.edu>
	* philoload now copies original source texts to the database
	image tree so that we don't have to worry about permissions,
	changes or deletions in the location from which it was loaded
	* new --linksourcetexts option to philoload stops this behavior;
	useful if you have a huge amount of text and not a lot of space, 
	and you promise not to make any changes to it
	* fixes to nserver.pl that should help it not refuse connections
	from genuine localhost while still refusing connections from 
	remote hosts

2004-05-28  Orion Buckminster Montoya  <orion@philologic.uchicago.edu>

	* search3 is now functional and the default engine.
	* Moved installation destination from /var/philologic 
	to /var/lib/philologic for better adherence to
	Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
	* gave up on fixing 'sort' commands to work with Solaris sort:
	you must use GNU sort or something else that's not braindead
	* new dependencies: GNU ld (binutils), GNU sort (coreutils)
	(GNU/Linux systems will, of course, have these, but e.g. 
	Solaris doesn't by default).

2004-05-14  Orion Buckminster Montoya  <orion@philologic.uchicago.edu>

	* Makefiles (all) now honor CFLAGS passed to ./configure
	* Makefile.in creates databases/, work/ and STATE on install
	* etc/philoload.pl.in now clean up work/ and STATE/ so that 
	multiple users may load databases without headaches
	* etc/philoload.pl.in new option --dontclean prevents removal
	of work/ and STATE/, which aids in diagnostics but probably
	shuts out other users

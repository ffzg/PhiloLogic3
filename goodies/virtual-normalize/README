These are the parts to integrate the Northwestern virtual 
normalization data. I have NOT included this data.  We have
it running for EEBO-TCP.  It requires a modified crapser, which 
takes arguments supplied by a patch in search3t and a three
field words.R.wom

You need to create a 3 field words.R.wom file in the database
directory from the Mapping file (MappedSpellings.txt).  I used
the included mergetab.pl for my first try.  The words.R.wom
file should look like:

  MOD    <tab>    ORIG    <tab>  ROOT
jealously       iealouslye      jealous

The ORIG word (field two) is the index entry word, so this is
the one sent to the system for searching.

I have included a commented virtnorm.crapser which should be 
copied and modified as requires to the database directory.  
This is, as noted, dumb as bricks.  Really should be fixed.

And then you need to add the interface to search3t ... basically
to pass the new arguments to crapser.  Again, should be standard.

============================ search3t ============================
ADD below
   push (@command, "crapser");

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Assuming that your search form has an ORTHMODE box......
if ($ORTHMODE) {
        if ($ORTHMODE =~ /LEM/i){
             $mvocrapcommand =  "-lem";
        }
        elsif ($ORTHMODE =~ /ORG/i){
             $mvocrapcommand =  "-org";
        }
        else {
             $mvocrapcommand = "-mod";
        }
}
# --------------------------------------------------------------
REPLACE 
# --------------------------------------------------------------
foreach $w (@words) {
    @FromCrapser = &TalktoExpand ($w, @command);
    @FromCrapser = sort @FromCrapser;
# --------------------------------------------------------------
WITH
# --------------------------------------------------------------
foreach $w (@words) {
    if ($mvocrapcommand) {
        @FromCrapser = &TalktoExpand ($w, @command, $mvocrapcommand);
        }
    else {
        @FromCrapser = &TalktoExpand ($w, @command);
    }
    @FromCrapser = sort @FromCrapser;
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# ===================================================================

This is a one off modification, basically a proof of concept.  We would
want to be a bit more coherent if we were going to make normalized
or lemma searching a standard feature.  Not much data yet.

This NServer startup kit can be used to make sure that NServer starts
on Startup for Mac OS X machines running PhiloLogic.

To install, click on the NServer directory and move it to
/Library/StartupItems/ or open up the Terminal application and type
the following at the command-line prompt:

cd /wherever/philologic/is/NSERVER_OSX/
sudo mv NServer /Library/StartupItems/

Be sure to make the startup script executable or it won't work!

sudo chmod +x /Library/StartupItems/NServer/NServer

This directory contains various parts that you may need.

philohistory.js:  Javascript required to make PhiloLogic Search
History work.  This goes into the SEARCH FORM for each database.
If you are using Philo3 with form support, this should be 
automatically added to the search form.

PUSH-to-HYPERPO: Code chunks to allow you to push whole documents
or parts of documents to external functions, in this case
HYPERPO.  Variants on this worked to also push to TaporWare

philologin.pl: an example cgi-bin script to allow users to
"login".  This registers single IP address to a spill file.
You will need to configure this for each database in the
script and in philo-db.cfg

philo.login.html: a dummy login form......

similiarity-crapser: a replacement for the standard word pattern
exploder using agrep.  Good for forcing similiarity searches primarily
for dirty OCR applications.  Almost certainly needs editing to get
gawk, perl, agrep locations right.  Also check the similarity 
values which get set by looking at length.  Note that agrep is NOT
Unicode aware!!!   ARTFL subscribers can see this in action in
  http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/ARTFL/projects/dicos/moreri/searchform.html
and we will add a form for a public resource when we get one. 
Finally the code has some comments.

greek2uft8.perl: chunk of a perl script that converts Chadwick-Healey
and HTML 4.0 character entities to UTF-8.

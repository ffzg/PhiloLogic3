These are some very useful utilities from the Digital Library
Extension Service (DLXS) at the University of Michigan.  All
rights belong to DLXS at the University of Michigan.

I include them here for reference purposes only and to make sure 
that ARTFL folks have access to them for internal development.  

Please consult the DLXS web site (http://www.dlxs.org/) for updates.   
There is some documentation available at
  http://www.dlxs.org/docs/12/class/unicode.html

The most useful at ARTFL so far are

ncr2utf8.pl:  Convert numeric character references (NCRs) and 
              SGML character entity references (CERs) to Unicode 
              UTF-8 encoded characters 
This could be included in the textload function, but we
decided that we would convert Numeric Character references
before loading.  

isocer2utf8.pl: Translate ISO Character Entity References
                to UTF-8.  This is an incredibly complete
                conversion function of character entities
                to UTF-8.  
We decided again to convert these before loading rather
than doing it dynamically.  

tif2web-1.0.3:  convert 2-color TIFF images to scaled-down web-ready
                images (GIF and PNG)
For future reference.  We have used earlier versions of this 
to handle dynamic image conversion and scaling.  Tarball included.

iso8859ToUtf8.pm: ConvertCollectionChars, Converst Collection 
                  specific Characters Entities to their corresponding 
                  unicode value.
Looks to be an older version of isocer2utf8.pl.  Kept here just in
case.

And finally two MARC record conversion utilities.  Here again, just
in case we find them useful.
